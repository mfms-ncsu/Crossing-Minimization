Needed -- a way to save state while the algorithm is running.
Idea -- identify each node internally with an integer id instead of a name.

Data structures:

1. An array of node pointers indexed by their internal identifiers (a node
   struct will also store the internal id).

2. An ord_struct holding an array of node id's for each layer. And,
   obviously, the number of layers and the size of each layer.

Functions:

save_order() - to create a new ord_struct and fill in the information based
on the current graph
    OrdPtr - pointer to the struct storing the information
The struct should be previously allocated.

restore_order() - to rearrange each layer using a given ord_struct
    OrdPtr - pointer to the struct holding the desired order
