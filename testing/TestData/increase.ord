# Ordering for the graph 'increase'
# Case where barycenter increases crossings after 1 iteration
# b3 and b4 are swapped even though they make fewer crossings in their
# original order.
#
# After one sweep, sorting both sides, the number of crossings is reduced to 1
# (from 13 or 14). 
#
# tree_100 is a larger example where the higher number of crossings is
# maintained in subsequent iterations. 

# Order for layer 0
0 {
 a0 a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6 a7
} # end of layer 0

# Order for layer 1
1 {
 b0 b1 b2 b3 b4
} # end of layer 1
