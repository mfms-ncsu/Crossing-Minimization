## ogml2sgf - convert from graphml used for output of Rome graphs
#             to the (s)imple (g)raph (f)ormat described below.
#  Usage: ogml2sgf input.gml > output.sgf
#
# Requires extract-ogml-graph.awk and extract-layers.awk  

# The graphml input is that for files provided by
#      Hoi-Ming Wong (Hoi-Ming.Wong@TU-Dortmund.de)
# It assumed to have a sequence of nodes, in the format
#             given by the example below:
#
# node [
# id 11
# label "11"
# graphics [
# x 300.0000000
# y -80.00000000
# w 20.00000000
# h 20.00000000
# fill ""
# line ""
# type "rectangle"
# width 1.0
# ]
# ]
#
# This is followed by a sequence of edges, each looking like:
#
# edge [
# source 7
# target 1
# label "1"
# graphics [
# type "line"
# arrow "last"
# ]
# ]
#
# Most of this information is ignored.

# The output will have the following format (blank lines are ignored):
#    c comment line 1
#    ...
#    c comment line k
#
#    t graph_name
#
#    n id_1 layer_1 position_1
#    n id_2 layer_2 position_2
#    ...
#    n id_n layer_n position_n
#
#    e source_1 target_1
#    ...
#    e source_m target_m
#
# edges are directed so that the nodes appearing earlier in the input are
# sources

    echo "Usage: ogml2sgf input.gml > output.sgf"
    exit 1
