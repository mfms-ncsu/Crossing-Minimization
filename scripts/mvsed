  USAGE: $cmd [-s script] filelist [target]

    Each file specified in filelist is moved to a new name, the new
    name being generated from old name using script of -s option.
    The script of -s is an edit command for sed.

    If -s option is not specified, then it is a regular move and it
    is necessary to specify a target.

  Example:
	$cmd -s s/ALU-PN/ALU_PN/ *.blif
